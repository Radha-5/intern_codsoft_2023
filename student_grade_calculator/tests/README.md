Student Grade Calculator

Sure thing! A student grade calculator in Java would likely be a program designed to take input on students' scores or grades in various subjects and then calculate their overall grade or GPA. 
It might incorporate factors like assignment scores, exam results, and possibly even participation grades. The program would likely include functionalities such as input validation, grade calculation logic, and possibly outputting a final grade or performance summary for each student. It's a practical project that could help users, especially educators, efficiently assess and manage student performance.
