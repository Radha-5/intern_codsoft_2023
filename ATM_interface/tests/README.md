ATM Interface
An ATM Interface Java program typically simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides a user-friendly interface for tasks such as checking account balances, making withdrawals, depositing funds, and possibly transferring money between accounts. The program would likely involve the use of classes and methods to represent different aspects of banking operations, ensuring modularity and code readability. Input validation and error handling would be crucial to enhance the user experience and maintain the integrity of financial transactions. 
The program may also incorporate features like PIN authentication and transaction logs to enhance security and accountability.
