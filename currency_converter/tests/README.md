Currency Converter
A currency converter program in Java is designed to facilitate the conversion of one currency to another based on the latest exchange rates. This program typically takes user input for the amount in a specific currency and the desired currency for conversion. It then utilizes up-to-date exchange rate data to perform the conversion and displays the equivalent amount in the target currency. The implementation may involve fetching real-time exchange rates from an API, handling user input, and presenting the results in a user-friendly manner. Overall, a currency converter in Java provides a practical tool for users to quickly and accurately convert monetary values between different currencies.
